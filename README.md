# LowPolyGenerator
A tool to help easily generate low poly art from normal pictures. 
The user can quickly generate a mesh either manually by clicking on where points in the mesh should be or have a simple one automatically generated for them. Afterwards, the user can either manually decide on a color for each region of the mesh or have the computer pick the best possible color for the region automatically. 

Future plans are to use computer vision in order to have a much better mesh created for the user automatically and decide colors that are "aesthetically" pleasing.
